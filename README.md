# Jumpstarting Software Engineering with a Friend

## What I'm looking forward to achieve

### 1. Guide her on how to use Git and Github.

***The following is what we achieved at the end of this lesson***

* Differences between git and github; how to use them.
* Git commands such as cloning, adding, committing, and pushing.
* Generating and setting https and ssh keys.
* Git branching, undoing in git, forking.

### 2. Introduction to Python

***We covered the following areas***

* **Foundation to python.** Here, we learnt about python basics, 
including variables, Data Types, Operations, and control structures.
* **Mastering python strings.** We tackled string operations, 
concertenation, repetation, length, accessing substrings, formating, 
and string methods.
* **Working with Python Integers.** Understand how to work with 
integers in Python, perform basic arithmetic operations, 
and apply integer-related functions.

* **Exploring the Power of Lists in Python.** We created, manipulated, 
and performed basic operations on Python lists.
* **Conditional Logic in Python.** Create simple and complex 
decision-making logic in Python using if, elif, and else statements, 
along with nested conditionals and conditional operators.
* **Python Loops: The Power of Repetition.** learning how to 
efficiently repeat code execution for various tasks. By the end, 
we confidently applied for and while loops to iterate over sequences, 
manipulated data structures, and used control flow tools like break, 
continue, and else to solve practical problems.
